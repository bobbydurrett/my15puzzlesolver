Working on a 15 puzzle solver in Python for Rosetta Code:

http://rosettacode.org/wiki/15_puzzle_solver

astar.py is my A* algorithm attempt.
stuck on about 3 seconds for a 21 move puzzle.
not fast enough for the RC 52 move puzzle.

idastar.py is my IDA* attempt. Jury is still out on
how fast it is.
